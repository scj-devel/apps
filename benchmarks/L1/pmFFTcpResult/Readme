This becnhmark uses nested private memory to encapsulate functions in a Fast Fourier transform library which
creates temporary objects that would otherwise have to be reclaimed by a garbage collector.
The code demonstrates the usecase of reusing existing libraries in an SCJ application and was
developed as part of ongoing activities in the CJ4ES project.
